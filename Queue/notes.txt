Definition -
 queue is a linear data structure that  follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
  means the first element added to the queue will be removed first. 

 Queue is an interface, and classes like LinkedList,ArrayDeque and PriorityQueue provide 
 implementations for this interface.
 
Components:
Front: The end from which elements are removed.
Rear: The end where elements are added.

Syntax:
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
