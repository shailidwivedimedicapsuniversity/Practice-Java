Array vs. ArrayList in Java

Size:
Array: Fixed size so you must have to define the size at the time of creation, 
and after that it cannot grow or shrink.
ArrayList: Dynamic size(Initail Capicity 10). It can grow and shrink automatically when
elements are added or removed.

Data Type:
Array: Can store both primitive types (e.g., int, char) and objects (e.g., String, Integer).
ArrayList: Can only store objects, not primitive types (e.g., you must use Integer instead of int).

Performance:
Array: Better performance due to its fixed size and direct memory allocation.
ArrayList: Slower compared to arrays, because resizing array when additions.

Memory:
Array: Takes less memory since it directly stores elements.
ArrayList: Requires more memory because it stores elements as objects.

Flexibility:
Array: Less flexible because the size is fixed and cannot be changed after creation.
ArrayList: More flexible as it can automatically resize as elements are added or removed.

Methods:
Array: Provides less built in methods like getting and setting elements.
ArrayList: Provides more built in methods, like add(), remove(), contains(), and
other list-specific methods.
