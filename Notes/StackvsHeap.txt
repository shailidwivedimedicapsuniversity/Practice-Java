Stack vs. Heap

1. Memory Allocation:
Stack: Static memory allocation (e.g., method calls, local variables).
Heap: Dynamic memory allocation (e.g., objects created with new).

2..Access Speed:
Stack: Faster access due to LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.
Heap: Slower access because of overhead in memory management.

3.Lifetime:
Stack: Data is automatically removed when the method call ends (temporary).
Heap: Data remains in memory until explicitly deallocated or garbage collected.

4.Size:
Stack: Typically smaller and has a fixed size.
Heap: Generally larger and can grow as needed.
