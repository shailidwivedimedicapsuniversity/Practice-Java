StringBuilder vs. StringBuffer

1.Thread Safety:
StringBuilder: Not synchronized (not thread-safe).
StringBuffer: Synchronized (thread-safe).

2.Performance:
StringBuilder: Faster, due to lack of synchronization.
StringBuffer: Slower because of synchronization .

3.Usage:
Use StringBuilder for better performance in single-threaded scenarios.
Use StringBuffer for safety in multi-threaded scenarios.

4.Mutability:
Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable.

Synchronized-
ensures that only one thread can access a resource or block of code at a time. 
This is important in multi-threaded environments to prevent data inconsistency
and ensure thread safety.
