List vs Set

Access:
List: Elements can be accessed via index (e.g., list.get(index)).
Set: Elements cannot be accessed via index; elements must be iterated.

Duplicates:
List: Allows duplicate elements.
Set: Does not allow duplicates.

Null Handling:
List: Allows multiple null values.
Set: Allows at most one null value.

Order:
List: Preserves insertion order.
Set: Does not preserve insertion order, except for LinkedHashSet (which does)
and TreeSet (which sorts elements).

Implementation:
List: Common implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack.
Set: Common implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

Usage:
List: Best for ordered collections and when duplicates are allowed.
Set: Best for unique collections where order doesnâ€™t matter or where elements must be sorted.

Iterator:
in List, Iterator and ListIterator can be used for traverse list.
in Set, only Iterator can be used since sets do not support indexing or bidirectional traversal.
