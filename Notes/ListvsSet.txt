List vs Set
Order:

List: Preserves the insertion order of elements.
Set: Does not guarantee any order (except for LinkedHashSet which preserves insertion order, and TreeSet which sorts elements).
Duplicates:

List: Allows duplicate elements.
Set: Does not allow duplicates.
Implementation:

List: Common implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList.
Set: Common implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.
Access Time:

List: Elements can be accessed via index (e.g., list.get(index)).
Set: No index-based access, elements must be iterated or searched.
Usage:

List: Best for ordered collections and scenarios where duplicates are allowed.
Set: Best for unique collections where order doesnâ€™t matter or must be sorted.
